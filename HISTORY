1.6.1
=====

* Custom NLP models can now make use of the exact matcher [#419, #442]
* Evaluation of NLP models now correctly distinguishes paraphrases and developer data,
  resulting in more accurate metrics [#446]
* Fixed developer NLP models [#409]
* Fixed killing GPU training jobs [#408, #410]
* Misc bug fixes [#438, #439, #443, #444, #445, #447, #450, #452]
* Updated dependencies [#440]

1.6.0
=====

* The automatic training system was refactored. Updating the exact match
  dataset after uploading a device is now significantly faster, and the chances
  of failure due to database lock timeout should be greatly reduced [#337, #395, #396].
* Automatic evaluation of trained model is now based on realistic data,
  not paraphrase data, which means the accuracy numbers reported in the admin
  dashboard are more meaningful [#337].
* The developer program is now controlled by a separate configuration variable,
  and can be enabled even if the embedded Thingpedia is not used [#337].
* Organizations can now upload custom Genie template packs, and create customized
  LUInet models that use a subset of Thingpedia, use custom template packs, or
  have different Genie parameters [#337, #395].
* An experimental credit system was added. Organizations receive credits for
  contributing public devices and template packs, and can use credits to create
  custom LUInet models [#380, #386].
* Added experimental support for creating custom Alexa skills backed by Thingpedia
  devices. These skills use Alexa AI (intent + slot classifier) [#371, #384, #395].
* Added a new API to lookup locations, which eliminates the need for location
  preprocessing in almond-tokenizer. Compatibility code for old ThingTalk versions
  has been added [#357, #358].
* Added a new API to upload devices. The API is OAuth-protected and is suitable
  to use in CI workflows to upload devices automatically after testing [#376].
* Added new API to download string datasets. The API requires a developer key
  to audit who downloads which dataset and ensure licensing compliance [#388].
* The snapshot lookup API now respects the developer key, closing another loophole
  that exposes unapproved devices. Only devices that were approved at the time of
  the snapshot are exposed. The list of snapshots is now public [#359].
* Primitive templates (dataset.tt entries / examples in Thingpedia API) now support
  a `#[name]` annotation, which is used to construct named intents for third-party
  AI integration [#371].
* docker builds of training and NLP inference servers are now officially supported,
  and we provide example configurations for Kubernetes. The example configurations
  match those used in our production infrastructure [#365, #399].
* The frontend classifier was revamped and converted to use PyTorch and pytorch-transformers
  instead of Keras and Tensorflow. This should result in a smaller dependency footprint
  and better model quality [#369].
* The initialization and routing logic in the frontend was refactored, so that
  public Thingpedia APIs are no longer accessible through cookie authentication, and no
  longer influenced by cookies. This is safer as it reduces the risks from CSRF [#382].
* I18n code was consolidated and made uniform. All pages now support a `?locale` parameter
  to retrieve the page and data in a different language (for supported languages) [#371].
* The rules for usernames and emails have been made stricter. Usernames are now case
  insensitive and must use ASCII alphanumeric characters only. Emails must be unique.
  This matches Discourse and helps when SSO integration is enabled [#350].
* Misc bug fixes [#350, #370, #372, #378, #382, #385, #387, #389, #395, #402].
* Updated dependencies [#343, #354, #361, #363, #374, #377, #390, #391, #393].

1.5.1
=====

* The website has been redesigned and has now clearer calls to action [#328].
* The /about/research page has been removed, and replaced with a link
  the OVAL website.
* The blog code has been expanded in functionality to support external
  news links [#329].
* The "Configure a new device" & "Add a new account" pages in My Almond
  have been merged [#326, #336].
* Rules for usernames and emails have been tightened, preventing duplicate
  users with similar usernames, invalid or dangerous usernames, or duplicate
  emails. This improved the compatibility with Discourse SSO [#350]
* Misc bug fixes [#336, #338, #339, #350]

1.5.0
=====

* The Thingpedia pages have been made more user friendly, with less code
  and more explanation of each device function [#259].
* 2-factor authentication now offers a "Remember Me" options [#289, #301].
* Users can now change their locale from the Settings, choosing from the
  enabled languages [#44].
* Added "Login With Github" option [#274, #290].
* The configuration format was changed, and no longer requires environment
  variables for security.
* Web Almond now offers Readline-like history [#172, #318].
* Translation support for refreshed and is now fully functional [#16, #17, #134, #302].
* New Thingpedia API: /entities/create and /strings/create to upload
  new entities or string datasets (useful for scripts) [#311].
* Updated documentation, with a particular focus on deploying a custom
  version of Almond Cloud [#283, #248, #277, #295, #296].
* Added experimental support for contextual predictions in the NLP server.
  This relies on an appropriately trained contextual Genie model; there is
  no automatic training support yet. The API might change in the future [#317].
* Added an experimental frontend classifier to the NLP server. This classifier
  determines a confidence level that the user input is a supported ThingTalk
  command, a general-knowledge question (suitable for a search engine) or a chatbot
  command. The API is experimental and the dialog agent does not make use of this
  information yet [#286, #294].
* Misc bug fixes [#22, #28, #272, #281, #288, #291, #292, #298, #299, #300, #303,
  #305, #307, #308, #315].
