  version of Almond Cloud [#283, #248, #277, #295, #296].

  determines a confidence level that the user input is a supported ThingTalk
  command, a general-knowledge question (suitable for a search engine) or a chatbot
  command. The API is experimental and the dialog agent does not make use of this
  information yet [#286, #294].
