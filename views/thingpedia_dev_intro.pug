          | Gabby Wright and Hemanth Kini are both music enthusiast.
          | They love music and want to control their music with voice with any device around them.
          | However, the Spotify skill on Alexa or Google Home does not do what they want such as
          | changing their playlist.
          | They built Almond Music together as a quarter-long class project with the goal
          | of creating the best music virtual assistant. We collaborate with them and hook it up
          | with both Alexa and Google Home.
          | The hookup layer is still under development. In the future, it will be fully automated
          | once a device is added to Thingpedia.

          | Permission control has been a pain point for voice virtual assistant.
          | In this video, we demo how Almond can be used to identify users with their voice
          | and provide fine-grained access control based on the detected identity.
          | The infrastructure of Almond not only supports access control locally,
          | it also allows two Almonds talk to each other remotely.
          | See our paper presented at UbiComp 2018 for more details.
