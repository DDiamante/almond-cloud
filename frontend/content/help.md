# Contributing to Almond

Developers can make contributions to the [codebase](https://github.com/stanford-oval/almond-cloud). Start by looking at the [Issues](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+user%3Astanford-oval+archived%3Afalse) section to get some ideas. If you have an idea of your own, feel free to [submit](https://github.com/stanford-oval/almond-cloud/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) a pull request.

**Can’t code?** You can still help move Almond forward. Currently, the project needs people with the following skills:

1. Technical writing
2. Marketing
3. Product design
4. UI/UX design
5. Language interface design

We also welcome material contributions like natural language processing and user behavior datasets.
