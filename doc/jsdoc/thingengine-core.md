This is the documentation for the [thingengine-core](https://npmjs.com/thingengine-core) library,
which is the core component of the Almond virtual assistant.
It includes the device configuration part, the parts of the ThingTalk runtime that interface with Thingpedia,
permission control and remote execution, cloud synchronization, and background services such as notifications and timers.

This library is only useful for integrators who are deploying Almond on a new platform, and
developers of Almond itself.
